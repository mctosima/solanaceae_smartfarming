PENYEMAI TANAMAN SOLANACEAE MENGGUNAKAN ARDUINO
UNO"

      Abstract 
      Technological developments have now spread globally to various fields. This includes the agricultural industry, which has now been 
      facilitated by the role of agricultural technology, such as plowing machines, rice planting machines, and so on.
      Agricultural technology was created to facilitate the production process of agricultural products which are a basic human need. 
      It is undeniable that the increasing human population, the greater the demand for agricultural products. 
      One of the most important agricultural products for meeting basic human needs is vegetables from the Solanaceae family such as chilies, 
      eggplants and tomatoes. However, currently vegetable farmers still use manual methods in their farming systems, 
      so the results produced by vegetable farmers are still not optimal. For example, in the process of seeding solanaceae seeds, 
      farmers still use manual methods, so failures often occur that result in losses. Based on these conditions, 
      a technology is needed that can minimize the failure rate during the Solanaceae seed sowing process. 
      In this research, an automatic incubator system for Solanaceae seed seedlings will be made to increase the success of the seeding process. 
      This prototype uses the Arduino Uno as the main controller, several sensors as detectors of environmental conditions, 
      several actuators as driving components, and a SIM800L module that can send notifications to farmers. 
      The sensors used are the Soil Moisture sensor to detect moisture in seedling media, DHT11 sensor to detect incubator temperature, 
      LDR sensor to detect light intensity, Ultrasonic sensor to detect plant height, and RTC sensor to detect time. 
      In its application, this tool is applied in the solanaceae seed sowing incubator. So that farmers do not need to care for or 
      control the seeds directly during the seeding process.
